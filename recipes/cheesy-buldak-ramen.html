  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This cheesy Buldak ramen casserole tames the heat—a little—with the addition of creamy mozzarella and American cheese. It's a quick and easy bake.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 (4.5 ounce) packages very spicy Korean ramen, such as Buldak® Ramen, </li>reserve 
    <li>seasoning packets, discard sauce packets</li>

    <li>3 cups water</li>

    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded creamy mozzarella cheese, divided</li>

    <li>6 slices American cheese, such as Kraft®</li>
    chili crisp, green onions, soft boiled eggs, furikake, for garnish (optional)
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Combine uncooked ramen, 3 seasoning packets, and 3 cups water in an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with half the mozzarella cheese; top with American cheese slices. Cover with foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven. Using tongs, gently toss ramen until liquid and cheese are combined. </li>
    <li>Add remaining mozzarella on top; place back into the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.</li>
